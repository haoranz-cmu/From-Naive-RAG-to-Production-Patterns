## 1. Naive RAG System Description

### 1.1 System Architecture

The naive RAG system was implemented using a standard retrieval-augmented generation pipeline with the following core components:

**Document Processing Pipeline**:
- **Data Source**: Historical documents from Wikipedia, processed into 3,200 passages with average length of 389.85 characters
- **Embedding Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384D) and `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` (512D)
- **Vector Store**: FAISS L2 distance index for efficient similarity search
- **Retrieval Strategy**: Top-k document retrieval using cosine similarity
- **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter API with multiple model support (GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek)

**Core Implementation Details**:
```python
# Key system parameters
embedding_dimensions = [384, 512]
retrieval_counts = [3, 5, 10]
prompt_strategies = ["basic", "few_shot", "persona"]
```

### 1.2 System Capabilities

The naive system demonstrated the following capabilities:
- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieval of relevant historical documents based on user queries
- **Answer Generation**: Context-aware answer generation using retrieved documents
- **Multi-Model Support**: Integration with various LLM providers for flexibility
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable retrieval counts and embedding models

### 1.3 Initial Performance Baseline

The naive system established baseline performance metrics:
- **F1-Score Range**: 0.40-0.457 (384D model), 0.60-0.657 (512D model)
- **Exact Match Range**: 0.40 (384D model), 0.60 (512D model)
- **Retrieval Quality**: Variable performance depending on query complexity and document relevance

## 2. Experimentation Results from Steps 3 and 4

### 2.1 Prompt Strategy Evaluation (Step 3)

**Experimental Design**: Three prompt strategies were evaluated on 5 test questions with fixed random seed (42).

**Results Summary**:
| Strategy | F1-Score | Exact Match | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Basic** | **0.7200** | **0.4000** | **0.4000** |
| Few-shot | 0.5467 | 0.6000 | 0.6000 |
| Persona | 0.3800 | 0.6000 | 0.6000 |

**Key Findings**:
- **Basic strategy achieved highest F1-score (0.72)**, demonstrating that simple, direct prompting is most effective for factual question-answering tasks
- Few-shot and persona strategies showed higher exact match rates but lower F1-scores, indicating over-verbosity in generated responses
- The basic strategy's success was attributed to minimal cognitive overhead and clear task specification

### 2.2 Parameter Optimization Analysis (Step 4)

**Experimental Design**: Comprehensive evaluation of embedding dimensions (384D vs 512D) and retrieval counts (k=3,5,10) across 5 test questions.

**Performance Results**:
| Group | Embedding Dim | Model | K Value | F1-Score | Exact Match | Improvement |
|-------|---------------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Group1 | 384 | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 3 | 0.4000 | 0.4000 | Baseline |
| Group1 | 384 | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 10 | 0.4571 | 0.4000 | +14.3% |
| Group2 | 512 | bge-base-en-v1.5 | 3 | 0.6250 | 0.6000 | +56.3% |
| Group2 | 512 | bge-base-en-v1.5 | 10 | 0.6571 | 0.6000 | +64.3% |

**Critical Insights**:
- **512D model significantly outperformed 384D model** with 50-64% F1-score improvement
- **Higher embedding dimensions capture richer semantic information**, leading to better retrieval quality
- **K=10 provided optimal performance** for 512D model, indicating that high-quality embeddings benefit from more retrieval documents
- **Model architecture matters**: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 outperformed sentence-transformers model at same dimension

## 3. Rationale for Chosen Enhancements

### 3.1 Query Rewriting Selection

**Rationale**: Query rewriting was selected to address the fundamental challenge of query-document semantic mismatch in RAG systems. The enhancement was designed to:

- **Improve Retrieval Precision**: Transform user queries into more effective search terms
- **Handle Query Complexity**: Automatically adapt rewriting strategy based on query complexity
- **Maintain Original Intent**: Preserve user intent while optimizing for retrieval effectiveness

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Three-tier approach**: Conservative, Balanced, and Aggressive rewriting strategies
- **Intelligent strategy selection**: Automatic complexity analysis and strategy recommendation
- **Quality control mechanisms**: Over-complexity detection and fallback to original query

### 3.2 Document Reranking Selection

**Rationale**: Document reranking was implemented to address the limitations of initial retrieval ranking. The enhancement was designed to:

- **Improve Relevance Scoring**: Use cross-encoder models for more accurate document-query relevance assessment
- **Optimize Final Results**: Re-rank retrieved documents based on fine-grained relevance scores
- **Enhance Answer Quality**: Provide better context for answer generation

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Cross-encoder integration**: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` model for relevance scoring
- **Configurable parameters**: Adjustable retrieval and reranking counts
- **Seamless integration**: Maintain compatibility with existing RAG pipeline

## 4. RAGAS Evaluation Results

### 4.1 Evaluation Framework

The RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) framework was used to evaluate both Basic and Enhanced RAG systems across four critical metrics:

- **Faithfulness**: Measures whether generated answers are grounded in retrieved context
- **Context Precision**: Evaluates relevance of retrieved context to the question
- **Context Recall**: Assesses coverage of ground truth information in retrieved context
- **Answer Relevance**: Measures direct relevance of generated answers to questions

### 4.2 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Basic RAG | Enhanced RAG | Performance Difference |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 1.000 | 1.000 | No difference |
| **Context Precision** | 0.70 | 0.70 | No difference |
| **Context Recall** | 0.600 | 0.600 | No difference |
| **Answer Relevance** | 0.534 | 0.424 | -0.110 (Basic RAG better) |

### 4.3 Unexpected Results Analysis

**Counterintuitive Findings**: The Enhanced RAG system unexpectedly underperformed the Basic RAG system in key metrics, despite incorporating advanced features.

**Potential Explanations**:
1. **Query Rewriting Over-optimization**: Enhanced query rewriting may have generated overly complex queries that deviated from original user intent
2. **Reranking Algorithm Mismatch**: Document reranking may have prioritized less relevant documents
3. **Feature Interaction Complexity**: The combination of multiple enhancements may have created interference rather than synergy

**Sample Size Limitations**: Evaluation was limited to 5 test samples due to API rate limits, potentially affecting result reliability and generalizability.
