# RAGAS Evaluation Report: Basic RAG vs Enhanced RAG

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using the RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) framework. The evaluation compares a Basic RAG system against an Enhanced RAG system across four critical metrics: Faithfulness, Context Precision, Context Recall, and Answer Relevance.

## Evaluation Results

### Evaluation Setup

- **Sample Size**: 5 test questions
- **Enhanced RAG Features**: 
  - Query rewriting with balanced strategy
  - Document reranking using cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
  - Enhanced search with k=5, rerank_k=3
- **Basic RAG Features**: Standard retrieval with k=5, top_k=3

### Performance Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Basic RAG | Enhanced RAG | Performance Difference |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 1.000 | 1.000 | No difference |
| **Context Precision** | 0.730 | 0.700 | -0.030 (Basic RAG better) |
| **Context Recall** | 0.600 | 0.600 | No difference |
| **Answer Relevance** | 0.534 | 0.424 | -0.110 (Basic RAG better) |

### Limitations

**Sample Size Constraints**: This evaluation is limited to 5 test samples due to API rate limits and computational costs. This small sample size introduces several limitations:

1. **Statistical Significance**: Results may not be statistically significant due to limited sample size
2. **Generalizability**: Performance patterns observed may not generalize to larger datasets
3. **Randomness Impact**: Small sample size increases the impact of random variations in results
4. **Feature Interaction**: Limited samples may not adequately test the interaction between enhanced features

**Recommendation**: For production deployment, conduct larger-scale evaluations with at least 100+ samples to ensure reliable performance assessment.

### Key Findings

**1. Faithfulness Excellence (1.000)**
Both systems demonstrate perfect faithfulness scores, indicating that generated answers are completely grounded in the retrieved context without hallucination. This suggests both RAG implementations successfully maintain factual accuracy.

**2. Context Precision Advantage: Basic RAG**
The Basic RAG system outperforms the Enhanced RAG system in context precision (0.730 vs 0.700), indicating that the basic system retrieves more relevant context relative to the questions asked. This unexpected result suggests that the enhanced features (query rewriting and document reranking) may be introducing noise or over-complicating the retrieval process.

**3. Context Recall Parity (0.600)**
Both systems achieve identical context recall scores, suggesting that neither system has a significant advantage in covering the ground truth information within retrieved contexts.

**4. Answer Relevance: Basic RAG Superior**
The Basic RAG system significantly outperforms the Enhanced RAG system in answer relevance (0.534 vs 0.424), indicating that the basic system generates more directly relevant answers to the posed questions.

## Analysis and Implications


### Recommendations for System Improvement

1. **Enhanced RAG Optimization**: Investigate and fine-tune the query rewriting and reranking algorithms to better align with user intent.

2. **Feature Ablation Study**: Conduct systematic testing to identify which enhanced features contribute positively versus negatively to performance.

3. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust the balance between query expansion and precision in the enhanced system.

## Conclusion

While both RAG systems demonstrate excellent faithfulness, the Basic RAG system unexpectedly outperforms the Enhanced RAG system in context precision and answer relevance. This evaluation highlights the importance of empirical testing in RAG system development, as theoretical improvements do not always translate to better performance. The results suggest that simpler, more direct approaches may be more effective for certain use cases, emphasizing the need for careful feature selection and optimization in RAG system design.
